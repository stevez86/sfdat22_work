####Resources:

* [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/) allows you to explore tons of different APIs. Alternatively, a Python API wrapper is available for many popular APIs.
* [The Data Science Toolkit](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/) is a collection of location-based and text-related APIs.
* [API Integration in Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/api-integration-in-python/) provides a very readable introduction to REST APIs.
* [Microsoft's Face Detection API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api#detection), which powers [How-Old.net](https://how-old.net/), is a great example of how a machine learning API can be leveraged to produce a compelling web application.
Web Scraping Resources:
* For a much longer web scraping tutorial covering Beautiful Soup, lxml, XPath, and Selenium, watch [Web Scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iX0uxM1w8) (3 hours 23 minutes) from PyCon 2014. The slides and code are also available.
* [import.io](https://www.import.io/) and [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) claim to allow you to scrape websites without writing any code. Its alrighhhtttttt
* [How a Math Genius Hacked OkCupid](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/all/) to Find True Love and [How Netflix Reverse Engineered](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/?single_page=true) Hollywood are two fun examples of how web scraping has been used to build interesting datasets.

### Class 5: Intro to Machine Learning / KNN

####Agenda

* Iris pre-work [code](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinanuozdemir/sfdat22/blob/master/notebooks/05_iris_prework.ipynb)
	* Using numpy to investigate the iris dataset further
	* Understanding how humans learn so that we can teach the machine!
* Intro to numpy [code](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinanuozdemir/sfdat22/blob/master/notebooks/05_numpy_ref.ipynb)
	* Numerical Python, code adapted from tutorial [here](http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/numpy.pdf)
	* Special attention to the idea of the np.array

* Intro to Machine Learning and KNN [slides](slides/05_ml_knn.pdf)
	* Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
	* Regression vs. Classification

* [Lab](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinanuozdemir/sfdat22/blob/master/labs/05_lab_knn.ipynb) to create our own KNN model


####Homework
* The one page project milestone as well as the pandas homework! [See requirements here](project.md)
* Read this excellent article, [Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html), and be prepared to discuss it in class on Wednesday. (You can ignore sections 4.2 and 4.3.) Here are some questions to think about while you read:
    * In the Party Registration example, what are the features? What is the response? Is this a regression or classification problem?
    * In the interactive visualization, try using different values for K across different sets of training data. What value of K do you think is "best"? How do you define "best"?
    * In the visualization, what do the lighter colors versus the darker colors mean? How is the darkness calculated?
    * How does the choice of K affect model bias? How about variance?
    * As you experiment with K and generate new training data, how can you "see" high versus low variance? How can you "see" high versus low bias?
    * Why should we care about variance at all? Shouldn't we just minimize bias and ignore variance?
    * Does a high value for K cause over-fitting or under-fitting?

    
**Resources:**

* For a more in-depth look at machine learning, read section 2.1 (14 pages) of Hastie and Tibshirani's excellent book, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). (It's a free PDF download!)

### Class 6: scikit-learn, Model Evaluation Procedures
* Introduction to scikit-learn with iris data ([code](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinanuozdemir/sfdat22/blob/master/notebooks/06_sklearn_knn.ipynb))
* Exploring the scikit-learn documentation: [user guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html), [module reference](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.neighbors), [class documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)
* Discuss the [article](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html) on the bias-variance tradeoff
* Look as some [code](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinanuozdemir/sfdat22/blob/master/notebooks/06_bias_variance_tradeoff.ipynb) on the bias variace tradeoff
	* To run this, I use a module called "seaborn" 
	* To install to anywhere in your terminal (git bash) and type in `sudo pip install seaborn`
* Model evaluation procedures ([slides](slides/06_model_evaluation_procedures.pdf), [code](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinanuozdemir/sfdat22/blob/master/notebooks/06_model_evaluation.ipynb))
* Glass Identification Lab [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinanuozdemir/sfdat22/blob/master/labs/06_lab_glass.ipynb)

**Homework:**

* Keep working on your project. Your [data exploration and analysis plan](project.md) is due in three weeks!

**Optional:**

* Practice what we learned in class today! Finish up the Glass data lab

**Resources:**

* Here's a great [30-second explanation of overfitting](http://www.quora.com/What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-overfitting/answer/Jessica-Su).
* For more on today's topics, these videos from Hastie and Tibshirani are useful: [overfitting and train/test split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2ij6eaaSl0) (14 minutes), [cross-validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZAM5OXrktY) (14 minutes). (Note that they use the terminology "validation set" instead of "test set".)
    * Alternatively, read section 5.1 (12 pages) of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), which covers the same content as the videos.
* This video from Caltech's machine learning course presents an [excellent, simple example of the bias-variance tradeoff](http://work.caltech.edu/library/081.html) (15 minutes) that may help you to visualize bias and variance.
